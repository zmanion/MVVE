# Minimum Viable Vulnerability Enumeration (MVVE)

## Summary

Vulnerability Management is, among other things, risk management. We want to improve and scale vulnerability managment to reduce risk.

Our goal is to develop a framework to support and guide any discussion, definition and evaluation of vulnerability information elements to improve the information driving vulnerability management. In summary, an information element should support one or more vulnerability management phases and activities activity, or else why bother with it.

To do this we:

* State observations and first principles
* Define phases of vulnerability management
* Enumerate and define information elements
* Define stakeholders as producers and consumers of information elements
* Generate a set of common use cases based on the producers, consumers, and lifecycle of information elements

The following documents exist:

* [Vulnerability Management](vulnerability_management.md) is Risk Management
* [Information Elements](information_elements.md)
* [Vulnerability Management Phases](phases.md)
* [Stakeholders](stakeholders.md)
