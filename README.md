# Minimum Viable Vulnerability Enumeration (MVVE)

## Summary

Our goal is to develop a framework to support and guide any discussion, definition and evaluation of vulnerability information elements to improve the information driving vulnerability management.
To do this we:

* Define phases of vulnerability management
* Enumerate and define information elements
* Define stakeholders as producers and consumers of information elements
* Generate a set of common use cases based on the producers, consumers, and lifecycle of information elements

The following documents exist:
