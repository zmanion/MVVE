# Vulnerability Management

Vulnerability Management is fundamentally risk management: coordinated activities to identify, assess, and act to reduce either the likelihood of successful exploitation and/or the impact and consequence created by the exploitation. 

We want to improve and scale vulnerability managment to reduce risk.

## Observations

Vulnerability information is distributed (between fewer primary and many secondary sources)

There is no one single authority for a vulnerability identifier

Both producers and consumers have varying level of commitment, interest and experience

Consumers already leverage multiple sources

We donâ€™t need every source to be a one-stop shop

## Principles

Must contain enough information to initiate the vulnerability management process for the product consumer. 

Must contain enough information to deduplicate and disambiguate each vulnerability even across sources.

All parties must arrive at the same answer for the same question, including names for things and values for measurements

## Implementation

Must contain a unique and public identifier for each record.

Removal of any one information element from the record negates the value.

All information is represented once and only once.

Must support typed relationships from one ID to another, within and across sources.

MVVE may be replaced with a strongly typed identifier from another source.

When intentionally duplicating (enriching), respect the authoritative source (refer to or keep up-to-date). 

Secondary sources are not limited to being additive, can disagree with non-MVVE elements.

The identifier alone is not sufficient to disambiguate.
